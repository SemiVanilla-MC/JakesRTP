# All messages sent in game by this plugin are stored here (and in the future in other files for other languages as
# well). (Correction: permission deny messages live in the plugin.yml file and can only be modified through there)
# This file should not be edited directly, but instead used as a reference for writing message overrides in
#   `language-settings.yml`.
# All messages will have a brief description, and an explanation of what each placeholder represents.
